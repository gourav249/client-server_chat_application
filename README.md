# client-server_chat_application
The communication over the network in TCP/IP model takes place in form of a client server architecture.
Chatting Applications are used for connect one hardware with another hardware which hardware may be in different network or same network.
We have introduced our chatting application on the basis of client-server architecture technology which is working on a same network.
But both client and server may or may not resides in a single system.
The client-server characteristic describes the relationship of co-operating programs in an application.
The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services.
Clients and servers exchange messages in a requestâ€“response messaging pattern. 
The client sends a request, and the server returns a response.
This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication.
